/**
 * @file ui_swatch.h
 * @brief The app's one colour-swatch painter: every swatch, chip band, colour
 *        dot and spool illustration ring draws its colour through here.
 *
 * Three layers, each built on the one below:
 *  - Pure decisions (no LVGL objects): the light/dark contrast edge, the
 *    multi-colour list, the equal-area diagonal split clipped to the shape,
 *    the finish a filament name announces and the size below which a finish
 *    is too small to read.
 *  - draw_swatch(): paints one swatch into a layer: the temp-graph legend
 *    calls it directly, the object paint below for everything else. Its finish
 *    texture is rendered once into a SwatchCache image and blitted.
 *  - swatch_paint_finish_pixels(): the same texture written straight into a
 *    pixel buffer, for illustrations that draw their own pixels (spool_canvas).
 *  - Object paint: apply_swatch_color() and the <swatch_paint> XML widget hang
 *    a DRAW_MAIN hook on an lv_obj so it paints through draw_swatch() with the
 *    object's own radius and size.
 *
 * Shape is the caller's: a pure colour is a circle (LV_RADIUS_CIRCLE), a
 * labelled chip or a colour area a rounded rect. See docs/devel/COLOR_SWATCHES.md.
