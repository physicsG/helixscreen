 *
 * Both are properties of the lane, not of the spool in it, and both are written
 * to the backend rather than to the slot's identity. The spool editor
 * (AmsEditOverlay) stages them in two dropdowns and commits them on Save; the
 * rules for what those dropdowns offer, refuse and write live here.
