/**
 * Semantic text widgets for theme-aware typography
 *
 * These widgets create labels with automatic font and color styling based on
 * semantic meaning, reading from globals.xml theme constants.
 *
 * Available widgets:
 * - <text_heading>: Section headings, large text (20/26/28 + text_muted)
 * - <text_body>:    Standard body text (14/18/20 + text_primary)
 * - <text_muted>:   Muted body text (14/18/20 + text_muted) for secondary content
 * - <text_small>:   Small/helper text (12/16/18 + text_muted)
 * - <text_xs>:      Extra-small text (10/12/14 + text_muted) for compact metadata
 *
 * All widgets inherit standard lv_label attributes (text, width, align, etc.)
 *
 * Text stroke/outline attributes (supported on all text_* widgets):
 * - stroke_width:  Outline thickness in pixels (e.g., "2")
 * - stroke_color:  Outline color as hex (e.g., "0x000000" or "#000000")
 * - stroke_opa:    Outline opacity 0-255 or percentage (e.g., "255" or "50%")
 *
 * Example:
 *   <text_heading text="Title" stroke_width="2" stroke_color="#000000"/>
 */

 * Initialize semantic text widgets for XML usage
 * Registers custom widgets: text_heading, text_body, text_muted, text_small, text_xs
 *
 * Call this after globals.xml is registered but before creating UI.

 * "Delta filament barrel base_Hyper PLA_49m" keeps both the name that
 * identifies the job and the material/duration suffix that tells it apart from
 * its neighbours. Width is measured with @p font, never counted in bytes or
 * characters, so a Cyrillic name is cut where it is drawn, not where a Latin
 * one would be.
 *
 * Pure over its arguments; it neither reads nor writes a widget.
 *
 * @param text         UTF-8 text to fit
 * @param max_width    Width the result must fit in, in pixels
 * @param font         Font the text is drawn with
 * @param letter_space Letter spacing the text is drawn with
 * @return The text, or "<head>…<tail>" when it does not fit
