/**
 * @brief The latest rendered screen, shared between the flush hook and the HTTP server.
 *
 * The flush hook (main thread) copies dirty rects into a shadow frame; the HTTP
 * thread turns the shadow into a JPEG on request. Nothing is allocated until a
 * viewer asks, and everything is freed once the viewer has been gone for
 * kViewerIdleMs. A static screen costs one encode in total: the JPEG is cached
 * with the frame generation it was made from.
 *
 * Thread-safe. The mutex is held for one rect's copy and for the RGB888
 * conversion, never across the JPEG encode.
