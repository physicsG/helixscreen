/**
 * @brief The clog meter's subjects, subscribed once, delivered as a snapshot.
 *
 * Every presentation of this data reads the same five AmsState subjects, and
 * before this each wired its own observers: five in UiClogBar, three in
 * UiClogMeter, and a fresh set again for each place either is instantiated
 * (the home tile, the Buffer Status modal, the AMS sidebar, the loaded-spool
 * card). Adding a sixth subject meant finding every one of those.
 *
 * A renderer now owns one of these and is handed a whole ClogMeterSample
 * whenever any field moves. The wiring lives here; what a reading *means*
 * lives on the sample (clog_meter_geometry.h), which is pure and tested
 * without LVGL. Renderers are left with only the drawing.
 *
 * Main thread only, like the observers it wraps: AmsState publishes through
 * ui_queue_update(), so callbacks arrive on the UI thread and may touch
 * widgets directly.
