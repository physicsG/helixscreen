/// "Recovery" means: bring a Klipper instance back to a usable state when
/// `firmware_restart` alone won't do it (e.g. K2's `klipper_mcu` daemon needs
/// to be bounced because a CFS retract error left the rpi MCU shut down —
/// see `key298: Can not update MCU rpi config as it is shutdown`, or the
/// Snapmaker U1 case where Moonraker has `[machine] provider: none` and
/// klippy_uds dropped so neither firmware_restart nor services.restart can
/// reach klippy).
///
/// **Chain** — each step only fires if the previous returns a recoverable
/// error (transport down / klippy disconnected / method unavailable):
///   1. `printer.firmware_restart` — proxies through klippy_uds. Always
///      tried first; on a healthy klippy it's the cheapest restart and
///      what users expect to see happen. Moonraker accepting it proves only
///      that the restart began, so the chain then polls `printer.info` for a
///      bounded window: `ready` completes, while `error` (a startup failure
///      such as key298) or no `ready` before the window ends runs step 2 once.
///      While Klippy keeps reporting `startup` the window stretches to the
///      chain's deadline instead, since a slow boot is not a failure; the
///      deadline ends the chain with no script. After the script exits 0 the
///      same poll runs once more, under the same deadline and without
///      escalating again, so a recovery that brings Klippy back reports it
///      ready. Without a local script the chain ends
///      at the first escalation: a startup error on a host with no platform
///      knowledge is a config fault no service restart clears, and the
///      app's klippy state already shows it.
///   2. **Local exec** of `$INSTALL_DIR/bin/helix-recover.sh` (this class
///      `fork()` + `execvp()`s it). The per-platform installer
///      (`scripts/lib/installer/recovery.sh`) writes the script with the
///      right `/etc/init.d/...` invocation baked in. Works even when
///      klippy is fully dead — that's the whole point. No-op on platforms
///      where the installer didn't ship a script (stock systemd Pi etc.).
///   3. `machine.services.restart klipper` — last resort. Only works on
///      hosts where Moonraker's `[machine] provider` is wired to a real
///      service manager (systemd_dbus / systemd_cli / supervisord_cli).
///
/// Frontend stays platform-blind: this class never learns platform names.
/// All platform knowledge lives in the shipped helix-recover.sh.
///
/// Lifetime: stateless free-standing helper, owned wherever it's invoked from
/// (typically the EmergencyStopOverlay or a toast action callback). The
/// chain outlives it; a chain whose Moonraker client is destroyed (printer
/// switch, soft restart) stops without calling either callback.
///
/// Single-flight: one chain runs at a time, process-wide. recover() while one
/// is running refuses through on_error.
