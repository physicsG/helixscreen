/**
 * @file display_metrics.h
 * @brief Physical display metrics and the UI scale factor derived from them.
 *
 * Every size constant in the UI is authored in pixels against a 160 DPI
 * reference, and the breakpoint ladder is selected from raw pixel dimensions.
 * That makes resolution a proxy for physical screen size, and the proxy breaks
 * on high-DPI panels: proportions stay correct while everything shrinks
 * physically in lockstep. A 1080x2400 phone at ~405 DPI draws a 192px grid cell
 * that measures 12mm, against the ~30mm the ladder intends.
 *
 * The fix is a multiplicative UI scale factor applied on top of the existing
 * ladder. Breakpoint selection stays on raw pixels, so no existing device can
 * change tier — regression is structurally impossible rather than merely
 * unlikely.
 *
 * @note This scale is deliberately NOT fed to lv_display_set_dpi(). LVGL
 *       derives padding from its DPI via LV_DPX_CALC, so raising it would
 *       resize padding on every shipping device. Application keeps forcing
 *       LV_DPI_DEF there, which is also what makes the UI immune to lying
 *       kernel drivers (see application.cpp). The two concepts stay separate.
