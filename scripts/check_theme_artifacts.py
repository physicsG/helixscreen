"""Fail a commit whose theme tokens moved without the artefacts derived from them.

Two committed files are generated from the <color>/<px>/<string> tokens in the
top-level ui_xml/*.xml:

  src/generated/theme_token_table.cpp   `make regen-tokens`, pure Python, so it
                                        is regenerated in memory and compared
                                        byte for byte.
  tests/fixtures/theme_const_golden.txt the [theme_pins] snapshot, which only
                                        the test binary can produce (it resolves
                                        tokens through LVGL at three
                                        resolutions). It is not regenerated here;
                                        this reports a staleness it can prove and
                                        prints the command.

What "provably stale" means for the golden, when it is not part of the commit:
its names are the XML token names, the base name of every suffixed token, and a
set of names C++ registers (read off HEAD's golden as whatever the HEAD XML does
not explain). An XML name missing from it, or a name it still lists that nothing
derives any more, is stale. So is a token whose HEAD value the golden records
verbatim and whose new value it does not. A value the golden does not record
verbatim (a responsive variant reads <unset>, its base resolves through
breakpoints) is left to the test. A golden that is part of the commit was
regenerated, and is trusted. One that regeneration leaves byte-identical (a
dropped XML token whose name C++ also registers) can never join the commit, so
HELIX_GOLDEN_CURRENT=1 records that it was regenerated and is current.

tools/xml-linter/schema/schema.json is the third artefact these tokens feed;
scripts/qc/xml_linter.sh owns it.
