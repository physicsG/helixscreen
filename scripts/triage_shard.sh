# triage_shard.sh BIN DIR SHARD COUNT FILTER [ORDER_FLAGS...]
#
# Post-mortem for one unit-sweep shard that failed, crashed or timed out
# (`diagnose_shards` in mk/tests.mk calls it per suspect shard). DIR holds the
# shard's console log as DIR/SHARD.log and the binary's last progress record
# (HELIX_TEST_PROGRESS_FILE) as DIR/SHARD.progress; FILTER and ORDER_FLAGS are
# what the sweep passed, so `--shard-count COUNT --shard-index SHARD` selects
# the same cases in the same order.
#
# It names the failing case(s) and re-runs them in up to four ways, cheapest
# first, stopping at the first that fails:
#
#   alone              the failing cases with nothing else in the process
#   alone, pinned      the same on one CPU (taskset -c)
#   composition        the whole shard again, same cases and order
#   composition, pinned
#
# and prints one verdict:
#
#   fails alone                      a real bug in the case or the code it covers
#   fails only pinned                timing: it needs a slow or contended CPU
#   fails only in shard composition  order dependence or state leaked by an
#                                    earlier case in the shard
#   did not reproduce
#
# An idle machine with free cores is the condition a timing flake never fails
# under, which is why the pinned runs exist: one core makes every thread the
# test starts compete with it, as a loaded sweep does.
#
# Bounded: each run is capped by TRIAGE_TIMEOUT seconds (default 300, the
# sweep's SHARD_TIMEOUT) and this shard's triage by TRIAGE_BUDGET (default
# twice that); TRIAGE_DEADLINE (epoch seconds, set by the sweep from
# TRIAGE_TOTAL_BUDGET) caps every shard's triage together. A stage that would
# start past either is skipped and named. A run that hits the timeout is
# reported as timed out, never as a reproduction: a hang says nothing about
# whether the case fails. TRIAGE_RETRIES (default 3) runs per stage.
# TRIAGE_CPU picks the core (default: the least busy one this process may
# use); the verdict names the core and the load it ran under.
# Without taskset (macOS) the pinned stages are skipped and say so.
#
# Always exits 0: the sweep's own verdict decides whether the run failed.
