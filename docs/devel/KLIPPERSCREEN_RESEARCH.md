# KlipperScreen Competitive Research

> Last updated: 2026-02-11 | Source: GitHub `KlipperScreen/KlipperScreen`

## Overview

KlipperScreen is a Python/GTK3 touchscreen interface for Klipper 3D printers. It communicates with Klipper via Moonraker's WebSocket and REST APIs.

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Language** | Python 3 |
| **GUI Framework** | GTK3 (via PyGObject) |
| **Communication** | Moonraker WebSocket (JSON-RPC) + REST API |
| **Display Servers** | X11, Wayland (Cage), Android (adb) |
| **Threading** | WebSocket on separate thread, `GLib.idle_add()` for thread-safe UI updates |
| **Config System** | ConfigParser-based, hierarchical merging (defaults → user → auto-generated) |
| **Theming** | CSS-based, multiple themes, runtime switching, font scaling |
| **Navigation** | Stack-based panel system with action bar (back/home/estop) |
| **Panels** | 35 total |
| **Custom Widgets** | 11 (heatergraph, bedmap, objectmap, keyboard, keypad, lockscreen, etc.) |
| **Languages** | 25+ via Weblate |
| **License** | GPL-3.0 |

### Architecture

## Feature Comparison

### What They Have, We Don't

#### Tier 1 — Critical Gaps

| Feature | Impact | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Camera/Webcam** | High | Multi-camera, MJPEG/WebRTC, MPV player. Top user request for remote monitoring |
| **Console/Terminal** | High | G-code input with color-coded output. Power users need this |
| **Screws Tilt Adjust Visual** | High | Their most praised calibration feature — visual screw diagram with CW/CCW indicators |
| **Multi-Printer Support** | Medium | Switch between Klipper instances. Important for farms/multi-printer setups |
| **Power Device Control** | Medium | Toggle GPIO/smart plugs. Useful for enclosure heaters, lights, PSU control |
| **Software Updater** | Medium | Update Klipper/Moonraker/KlipperScreen from the touchscreen |

#### Tier 2 — Nice to Have

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| Pressure Advance panel | Dedicated PA coefficient tuning UI |

|---------|-------------|
| **PID Tuning UI** | Unique across all Klipper touchscreens — guided PID calibration workflow |
| **3D Bed Mesh** | Interactive 3D visualization vs their 2D grid |
| **AMS/ERCF Support** | Full multi-material panel with slot management — no other touchscreen has this |
| **Print Start Profiles** | JSON-driven, printer-specific phase detection and automation |
| **First-Run Wizard** | Guided setup: WiFi, printer ID, device detection, touch calibration |
| **GCode Viewer** | 3D visualization of print paths with layer inspection |
| **Print History Dashboard** | Job history with analytics and statistics |

## Strategic Gaps — Prioritized

Features HelixScreen should consider, ordered by user impact:

### Priority 1 — High Impact

1. **Camera/Webcam Panel** — Remote print monitoring is a top user expectation. Support MJPEG streams at minimum, WebRTC for low latency. Multi-camera selection.

2. **Console Panel** — G-code command terminal. Essential for power users, debugging, and running one-off commands. Color-coded output, command history.

3. **Screws Tilt Adjust Visualization** — KlipperScreen's most praised feature. Visual bed diagram showing probe results with turn direction/amount indicators at each screw position.

### Priority 2 — Medium Impact

4. **Multi-Printer Support** — Useful for printer farms and users with multiple machines. Switch between Moonraker instances without restarting.

5. **Power Device Panel** — Toggle smart plugs, GPIO pins, enclosure heaters/lights from the touchscreen. Moonraker already exposes the API.

6. **Software Updater** — Update Klipper/Moonraker from the touchscreen without SSH. Convenient but also risky (bricking potential).

### Priority 3 — Lower Priority

7. **Lockscreen** — Screen lock for shared environments or child safety.
8. **Pressure Advance Panel** — Dedicated PA tuning UI (we may already support this via macros).
9. **System Info Panel** — CPU/RAM/disk stats, service management.
10. **Dedicated Notifications Panel** — Historical notification log with filtering.

### Not Worth Copying

- **Pins panel** — Very niche, most users never need it
- **Wayland/X11 compat work** — We use LVGL directly, not relevant
- **ConfigParser system** — Our JSON/XML approach is already better
- **GTK CSS theming** — Our token-based design system is more structured

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **KlipperScreen is mature but slow-moving** — ~9 commits/month, 66% from one maintainer. Stability-focused, not innovating rapidly.

2. **Our architecture is stronger** — Native C++/LVGL beats Python/GTK on performance, touch reliability, and embedded deployment. Their Wayland struggles don't apply to us.

3. **Their feature breadth is wider** — 35 panels covering edge cases we haven't touched (camera, console, power devices, multi-printer). We're deeper on calibration and visualization.

4. **Camera is the biggest gap** — It's table stakes for a printer touchscreen. Users expect to see their print from the screen.

5. **Console is the second biggest** — Power users reach for SSH when they can't send G-code from the screen. A console panel keeps them in the UI.

6. **We're winning on calibration** — PID tuning, 3D bed mesh, input shaper visualization, print start profiles. Nobody else has these.

7. **We're winning on modern UI** — First-run wizard, theme editor, sound system, telemetry, plugin system. KlipperScreen feels dated in comparison.
