# Silent brick history:
#   v0.99.41: HELIX_PLATFORM_SNAPMAKER_U1 missing from current_key() →
#             U1 devices downloaded helixscreen-pi-*.tar.gz on self-update,
#             ended up with a binary that NEEDED libsystemd/libinput/libEGL/
#             libGLESv2/libgbm — none present on U1 → exec failure.
#   Earlier:  HELIX_PLATFORM_X86 missing from the same function (fixed by
#             640b2a6ab).
#
# These tests enforce that:
#   1. Every -DHELIX_PLATFORM_* define in mk/cross.mk has a matching branch
#      in src/system/platform_table.cpp::current_key().
#   2. Every PLATFORM_TARGET in the release.yml matrix has a corresponding
#      entry in the known_platforms allowlist in test_update_checker.cpp
#      (so a missing branch fails unit tests instead of silently shipping).
#   3. Every platform key returned by current_key() is also in the
#      known_platforms allowlist (catches typos in the return string).
#   4. The crash worker's KNOWN_PLATFORMS allowlist carries every current
#      current_key() value plus an explicitly-declared set of retired
#      keys. The worker refuses crash reports from platforms outside that set,
#      so a current key missing there silently drops a platform's reports;
#      retired keys stay for as long as old binaries exist in the field, and
#      each must carry a one-line reason in the worker file.
