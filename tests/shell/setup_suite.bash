# Host sandbox for the whole bats suite.
#
# bats loads this file automatically for a directory run, before any test file.
# Nothing in a .bats file has to opt in, so a new test is sandboxed on the day
# it is written and a test that forgets to `load helpers` is covered anyway.
#
# What it blocks: commands that address the HOST by name rather than by a handle
# the test owns. `killall helix-screen` and `pidof dropbear` name a process this
# test did not start, so they reach whatever else is running on the machine -
# another bats file's app, or the developer's own. `kill "$pid"` is not in the
# list: a pid is a handle the test already holds, so it is scoped by
# construction. That distinction is the whole rule.
#
# A blocked call is recorded in the ledger with the test that made it and then
# fails; teardown_suite fails the run and prints the ledger. A test that needs
# one of these commands mocks it explicitly - mock_command* writes into
# $BATS_TEST_TMPDIR/bin, which is prepended later and therefore wins, and a
# shell function beats both. Mocked calls never reach the shim, so they never
# appear in the ledger.
#
# Two layers, because neither survives every boundary a test crosses:
#
#   PATH shims       survive a non-bash callee (installer scripts are #!/bin/sh,
#                    and sh does not import bash's exported functions), and are
#                    lost when a callee REPLACES PATH rather than prepending to
#                    it - `env PATH="$bin" ...`, or a script that hardens PATH
#                    by putting the stock system directories first.
#   Exported shell   survive PATH replacement and PATH hardening, and are lost
#   functions        at a non-bash callee.
#
# The union covers every boundary this suite actually crosses. The residual gap
# is a callee that is BOTH non-bash AND replaces PATH; test_sandbox_gate.bats
# pins that gap closed by failing any PATH assignment in tests/shell that drops
# the sandbox directory.

# Commands that address the host by name. Keep this list and the gate test's
# copy in step - the gate fails if they diverge.
